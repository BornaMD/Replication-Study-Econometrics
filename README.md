# Replication-Study-Econometrics

This is our workspace in R for the Econometrics Replication Study.  
This project was something I did in 2018 as end assignment for the econometrics for Economists course.  
The file that is complete in all requirements to run the descriptive statstics and the regressions is: [Replication Study Script](https://github.com/BornaMD/Replication-Study-Econometrics/blob/master/New%20R%20Sript%20Replication%20Study.R)
